/*Question 2:
Write a program to build ticketing software for a Zoo using Object Oriented Programming. If you are
not familiar or comfortable with object-oriented programming, we suggest you give this article a
quick read to ensure you understand it before you attempt it.
It should have the following features:
1. When the guests arrive at the entrance gate, the person at the ticketing counter should
input the number of guests and age of each guest. The pricing depends on the age as
follows:
a. If age <= 2 years, entrance price is INR 0.
b. If age > 2 and < 18 years, entrance price is INR 100.
c. If age >= 18 and < 60 years, entrance price is INR 500.
d. If age >= 60 years, entrance price is INR 300. */
