/* 2. Before entering the Zoo, the security personnel should be able to validate the ticket i.e.,
they should be able to see the guests and their age associated with the ticket and manually
verify the guests who are trying to enter the Zoo.
Your software should be able to take an issued ticket and display ticket details (a line for
each guest on the ticket - person, age) so security personnel can confirm the guests before
letting them enter the Zoo. Ex: If a ticket was issued for 2 guest (age 23 and 25), it should
display:
Guest 1 (age: 23)
Guest 2 (age: 25)
